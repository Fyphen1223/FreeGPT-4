# Development Paused Notice

Development of FreeGPT-4 has been temporarily paused. We are currently finding a new way to acquire POE premium tokens. 

In the meantime, we recommend using [GPT-4 Unlimited for Phind](https://github.com/Lomusire/gpt4-unlimited-phin) for unlimited free GPT-4 web search access. 

We appreciate your understanding and patience. We'll be back as soon as we can with updates.
